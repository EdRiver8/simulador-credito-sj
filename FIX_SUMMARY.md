# Fix Summary: Credit Simulator Balance Issues

## Problem Identified

The "Simulador de Abono Extra" (Extra Payment Simulator) was not properly zeroing out loan balances in final payments, causing remaining balances instead of completing the loan payoff.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Inadequate Final Payment Detection

**Location**: `PaymentReductionSimulation.calculate()` method around line 815
**Issue**: The condition `(i === this.numberOfPayments && saldoNuevo > 0)` was too restrictive and didn't properly handle cases where the remaining balance was less than the normal capital payment.

**Fix Applied**:

```javascript
// OLD (problematic):
if (saldoNuevo <= capitalNormal || (i === this.numberOfPayments && saldoNuevo > 0)) {

// NEW (fixed):
if (saldoNuevo <= capitalNormal || (i === this.numberOfPayments) || saldoNuevo < 1) {
```

### 2. Base Class Final Payment Logic

**Location**: `PaymentSimulation.generateAmortizationTable()` method around line 510  
**Issue**: The final payment detection was overly complex and didn't handle edge cases properly.

**Fix Applied**:

```javascript
// OLD (problematic):
if (i === this.numberOfPayments) {
  if (
    remainingBalance - capitalPayment < 1 &&
    remainingBalance - capitalPayment > -1
  ) {
    capitalPayment = remainingBalance;
  }
}

// NEW (fixed):
if (
  i === this.numberOfPayments ||
  remainingBalance <= capitalPayment ||
  remainingBalance < 1
) {
  // Final payment - pay exactly the remaining balance
  capitalPayment = remainingBalance;
}
```

### 3. Code Formatting Issues

**Location**: Multiple places in `PaymentReductionSimulation.calculate()`
**Issue**: Missing line breaks caused code readability issues and potential parsing problems.

**Fixes Applied**:

- Line 780: Added line break between variable declaration and table.push()
- Line 773: Added line break between variable declarations
- Line 812: Added line break after extra payment application block

## Technical Details

### Logic Improvements:

1. **Simplified final payment detection**: Now checks three conditions:

   - Is this the last scheduled payment?
   - Is remaining balance less than or equal to normal capital payment?
   - Is remaining balance less than 1 peso?

2. **Consistent balance handling**: Both base class and payment reduction simulation now use the same logic for ensuring final balances reach zero.

3. **Better edge case handling**: Handles scenarios where extra payments or interest calculations might leave very small remaining balances.

## Files Modified

- `main.js` - PaymentReductionSimulation.calculate() method
- `main.js` - PaymentSimulation.generateAmortizationTable() method

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. ✅ All extra payment simulations should properly zero out final balances
2. ✅ "Disminuir Cuota" (Payment Reduction) scenarios should complete properly
3. ✅ "Abono a Capital" (Capital Payment) scenarios should complete properly
4. ✅ Comparative simulations should show accurate final balances
5. ✅ No more remaining balances in completed loan calculations

## Testing Recommended

1. Test basic loan without extra payments
2. Test single capital payment scenarios
3. Test recurring capital payment scenarios
4. Test period-limited capital payment scenarios
5. Test payment reduction scenarios
6. Test comparative scenarios with different parameter combinations
